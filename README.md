# Input-Code-Door-Lock

Door lock is one of the most basic levels of security since it is one of the barriers that prevent unwanted individuals from entering a space. Over time, door locks have evolved from simple key-lock to key number pads and other micro-controlled locks. The common practice of these button key password locks are in places with high-demand of security. Button key password locks are helpful because they do not require a key to unlock the door, but rather the user knowing the password (key) to access the location. However, the flaw of these locks are due to how easily these keys can become unsecured which compromise the security of this lock. Regardless, the main objective is to design a Python program that can implement password door lock and demonstrate its functionalities via circuitry components.
